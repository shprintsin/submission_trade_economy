Using the recent US whiskey tariffs implemented as a result of political strife, we utilize a differences-in-differences specification to show that, on average, US whiskey producers decrease US product prices following a sharp increase in foreign export tariffs. However, in cross-sectional analyses, we find that producers implement strategic product pricing in response to the foreign tariffs, by more significantly decreasing prices in states where whiskey consumption is less popular, and by increasing prices in primary production states (Kentucky and Tennessee). Further, we provide evidence that following the tariffs, US whiskey producers decrease advertising spending across the US but not in Kentucky and Tennessee. Taken together, these findings provide timely evidence regarding how foreign trade restrictions significantly impact the US product market and consumer outcomes.},

	abstract = {Bourbon whisky is one of the world’s most popular spirits and is a vital component of U.S. spirits exports. Yet, very limited research has examined the trade patterns of U.S. bourbon whisky. The purposes of this paper lie in (i) filling a void in the literature about the driving forces behind U.S. bourbon whisky exports, especially justifying the impact of geographical indications and trade disputes, and (ii) examining global and regional trade efficiency and trade potential of U.S. bourbon whisky, considering consumer preferences. This study adopts the stochastic frontier gravity model and trade inefficiency model to analyze bourbon trade patterns between the U.S. and its primary bourbon trade partners over 1990–2019. Results reveal that economic size, income level, trade facilitation, common language and the weighted share of adults who drink in the importing country are important factors in boosting bourbon trade flows. As expected, U.S. bourbon’s geographical indication is playing a significant role in boosting bourbon exports. Trade disputes between the U.S. and its trading partners are found to have significantly negative impacts on U.S. bourbon exports. Our research also reveals that U.S. bourbon whisky has great potential to reach markets throughout the world, particularly in Europe, North America and Oceania.},

	abstract = {Aims To review trade agreements, their relation to alcohol control policy and examine the role of the alcohol industry in supporting and attempting to inﬂuence trade policy. Methods Review of peer review, public health advocacy literature (both pro and con on free trade), business, press and government documents on trade agreements, assess current and potential challenges by trade agreements to alcohol control policy and investigate the means and extent of industry inﬂuence in trade agreements. Findings ‘Free’ trade agreements reduce trade barriers, increase competition, lower prices and promote alcohol consumption. However, international treaties, negotiated by free trade experts in close consultation with corporate lobbyists and without signiﬁcant, if any, public health input, governments and corporations contain signiﬁcant provisions that will result in increased alcohol consumption and may challenge public health measures of other nations as constraints on trade. Conversely, alcohol control measures seek to reduce access and consumption, raise prices and restrict advertising and product promotion. The prospect is for increased alcohol consumption and concomitant problems throughout the world. Conclusions Trade agreements challenge effective alcohol control policies. The alcohol industry seeks to inﬂuence agreements and can be expected to work through trade agreements to reduce tariffs, increase market access and seek to restrict effective domestic regulations. Further research is needed on the impact of trade agreements and the ongoing role of the industry. Advocates must recognize the inherent conﬂicts between unbridled free trade and public health, work to exclude alcohol from trade agreements, counter industry inﬂuence and protect alcohol control policies.},

Further, we cannot reject the hypothesis that the very heaviest drinkers have perfectly price inelastic demands.},

This study estimates US import demand across various spirit categories (e.g., tequila, whiskey) and assesses the potential impact of the proposed tariff. Findings project that imports could decline by more than \$1.0 billion, potentially falling by as much as \$1.4 billion, primarily due to a substantial decrease in tequila imports. Interestingly, even imports not subject to the tariffs are expected to decline due to the complementarities in importing. Despite the inelastic nature of demand, the results suggest that trade losses would exceed any revenue gains from the tariffs.},

We illustrate these conventional approaches by applying them to the tariffs introduced by the Trump administration during 2018. In the wake of this increase in trade protection, the United States experienced substantial increases in the prices of intermediates and final goods, dramatic changes to its supply-chain network, reductions in availability of imported varieties, and the complete pass-through of the tariffs into domestic prices of imported goods. Therefore, the full incidence of the tariffs has fallen on domestic consumers and importers so far, and our estimates imply a reduction in aggregate US real income of \$1.4 billion per month by the end of 2018. We see similar patterns for foreign countries that have retaliated with their own tariffs against the United States, which suggests that the trade war has also reduced the real income of these other countries.},

	abstract = {In its action plan (2022–2030) to reduce the harmful use of alcohol, the WHO calls on economic operators to “substitute, whenever possible, higher-alcohol products with no-alcohol and lower-alcohol products in their overall product portfolios, with the goal of decreasing the overall levels of alcohol consumption in populations and consumer groups”. This paper investigates substitution at the level of the consumer, based on Spanish household purchase data. ARIMA modelling of market research data of 1.29 million alcohol purchases from 18,954 Spanish households is used to study the potential impact of lower-strength alcohol products and the impact of beer prices in reducing household purchases of grams of alcohol between the 2nd quarter of 2017 and 1st quarter of 2022. Reducing the alcohol strength of existing higher-strength beers and wines had a much greater associated impact on reducing the purchases of all grams of alcohol than the relatively small increases in purchases of no-alcohol beers (ABV ≤ 1.0\%) and zero-alcohol wines (ABV = 0.0\%). For beers, the relative price per gram of alcohol decreased with the increasing ABV of the beer. Increasing the price per gram of alcohol in beers with an ABV {\textgreater} 3.5\%, adjusted for the ABV of the beer, was associated with much greater increases in purchases of no-alcohol beers (ABV ≤ 1.0\%) and much greater decreases in purchases of all grams of alcohol than decreases in the price of no-alcohol beers or increases in the price of beers with an ABV {\textgreater} 3.5\% unadjusted for ABV. Thus, a key to reducing purchases of grams of alcohol, which also results in increased purchases of no-alcohol beers, is to increase the price of higher strength beers (ABV {\textgreater} 3.5\%) with the price per gram of alcohol increasing as the ABV of the product increases.},
